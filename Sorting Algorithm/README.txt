#Insertion Sort Algortihm Written In Assembly Language

A list A (array A) of integer numbers (each integer in 4-bytes) have been stored in memory. MIPS register $s0 hold the base address of list A, register $s1 stores the length of the list A.

You can find the description and the Python implementation of the insertion sort algorithm in the following link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort/

There are variables key (the list item that is compared with others items) and i (index of the for loop) in Python implementation. 
In MIPS implementation, register $t0 assigned to the variable key and register $t1 assigned to the variable i.
